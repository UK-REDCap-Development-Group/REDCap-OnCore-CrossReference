The REDCap OnCore Cross Reference (ROCS) tool provides a highly configurable connection between a REDCap project and an OnCore instance. ROCS adds a new page on the left-hand menu of a project called "OnCore Field Mappings" which allows a user to include or disclude forms from a project for mapping.

Once a form has been selected for mapping, the user is able to select a field pulled from OnCore's API in a dropdown. Once a selection is made, it is saved to the module's project configuration. Dropdowns allow for a user to type field names in the event they know what they are looking for and do not want to scroll through the often extensive list of available fields.

ROCS includes an autosave feature which is triggered when critical actions are performed. Critical actions are defined as when a user updates selected forms through the "Manage Forms" interface, and when fields are mapped using the dropdowns.
